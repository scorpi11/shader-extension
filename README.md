Shader
======

This is a Gnome shell extension to run a GLSL shader loaded from a file.

-----------

Copy this folder to the gnome-shell extension folders, typically under
`.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions`.

In a terminal, you can use the following commands:

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/scorpi11/shader-extension`

mv shader-extension ".local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/shader@tikei.de"
```

You can now enable the extension in the Gnome extension settings.
